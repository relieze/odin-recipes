    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Zucca toscana, or Tuscan pumpkin, is a popular variety of winter squash
      grown in the region of Tuscany, Italy. It is known for its distinctive
      shape, resembling a large ribbed acorn with a vibrant orange color. Zucca
      toscana is highly versatile and often used in traditional Tuscan cuisine
      to make delicious soups, risottos, and roasted dishes, offering a
      delightful combination of sweetness and earthy flavors.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
      <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
      <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15
        minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10
        minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in
        the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until
        onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes
        and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium;
        stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach
        has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
      </li>
